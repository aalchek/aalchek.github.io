  In computer science, you have different pieces of data that come in all different sizes. Some example of singular pieces of data include integers, floats, strings, and booleans. However, often times, you need to store more than one piece of data. For example, if you were going grocery shopping and needed milk, eggs, and butter, the way you would best be able to keep track of all of those ingredients is through some sort of list (rather than have a different data structure for each ingredient needed). Data structures such as arrays and Hashes are perfect for keeping track of multiple data points. An <span class=itbold>Array </span> is an ordered list that can contain strings, numbers, etc where a user can store a piece of data at a particular index. The key part is that it is ordered For example, if I had an array called Grocery_List and wanted to know the fifth item on my list(indexing starts at 0), I could just type in Grocery_List[4] and find out that I needed "5 lbs of Chicken thighs" A <span class=itbold>Hash map</span> on the other hand, is more like a dictionary. For example, in a dictionary you can look up something specific such as the definition of the word "Jam, noun (food)" and you would see the defintion "A preserve of fruit boiled with sugar". The word points to the definition in the hashmap. It's not organized by an index in the same way that an array is, but rather is more of a collection of definitions where point A directs to point B.

So far, my biggest struggle has been pairing. I had some understanding of CS coming into DBC and I've picked up new concepts very quickly. However, pairing has been difficult because I haven't found a good balance between driving and navigating. When I work on an exercise, sometimes when I am driving, I immediately know how to solve a problem very quickly and type out my solution before my pair can even get his/her opinion across. At the same time, when I navigate, I have to find out how I can better guide my peers without barking orders (this is an overstatement but I do want to get my point across of my weaknesses when pairing). I think that my weakness comes from how I think and learn. As someone who has focus issues, I often try and make every conversation as interactive as possible. However when pairing, I either have an idea and want to get it out as soon as possible or I want to find a way to help guide my pair without seeming too biased. My plan of action now is much like I would with any job. Keep a pad of paper next to me so I can write down my thoughts rather than implement immediately. I also think slowing down will help. Those are all my thoughts for this week!
