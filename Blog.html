Margins, borders, and padding all come together for any object whether it is physical or electronic. A border is the outermost shell of an object. Think of it like the plastic exterior of a bottle of water. There is nothing that is physically part of the water bottle outside of the bottle itself. In the same way, a border is the outer most piece of an object. The padding is what is in between the content and the border. Think of it as a layer (potentially protective) on the inside that is not the main content. In the case of the water bottle, maybe there is some sort of inner padding of the bottle that keeps the water colder longer. The margin is the distance between the border (the exterior of the object) and whatever objects are near it. For example, the margin may be the distance between other water bottles or the ground touching it (depending on what part of the exterior your measure the margin from).

I think the main piece of motivation/awareness that I got from Shareef's fireside chat is DBC's focus on continual self-improvement. Shereef talks about taking control of your education, being inspired, co-creating with your cohort, giving back, and learning. When I commited to DBC, I was not thinking about this in terms of the experience. I was focused on the full-stack experience. However, I believe that continual self improvement and awareness are core pieces of my personality. I always have sought peers who do as much in the classroom or on the job as they do outside of it. I admire that DBC instills a sense of continuous improvement and involvement in software engineering because that means that DBC attracts and inspires movers and shakers. I'm excited and intrigued to work with a motivated, creative, and tenacious cohort.
