Tracking and adding changes makes developers' lives easier because it gives them the ability to understand a file's progression. This is a very key point of version control: a developer needs to understand what changes were made to a file. A commit is a checkpoint/save point in a file being created/updated where a developer can choose to continue or go back to a past point.
