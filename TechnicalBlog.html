Margins, borders, and padding all come together for any object whether it is physical or electronic. A border is the outermost shell of an object. Think of it like the plastic exterior of a bottle of water. There is nothing that is physically part of the water bottle outside of the bottle itself. In the same way, a border is the outer most piece of an object. The padding is what is in between the content and the border. Think of it as a layer (potentially protective) on the inside that is not the main content. In the case of the water bottle, maybe there is some sort of inner padding of the bottle that keeps the water colder longer. The margin is the distance between the border (the exterior of the object) and whatever objects are near it. For example, the margin may be the distance between other water bottles or the ground touching it (depending on what part of the exterior your measure the margin from).

What are the benefits of version control? How does git help you keep track of changes? Why use GitHub to store your code?

The benefits of version control are<br>
-ability for multiple people to work on same file at once without overwriting each other<br>
-go back to earlier version (ex if hard drive crashes or if you delete something)

Git helps you keep track of your changes by allowing you to add messages to each commit (save point) you make.<br>
Github is great for storing code because it organizes it all in a GUI. Provides a common hub for finding open source projects, showing off your work, and collaboration.
