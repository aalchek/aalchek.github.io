What are the benefits of version control? How does git help you keep track of changes? Why use GitHub to store your code?

The benefits of version control are<br>
-ability for multiple people to work on same file at once without overwriting each other<br>
-go back to earlier version (ex if hard drive crashes or if you delete something)

Git helps you keep track of your changes by allowing you to add messages to each commit (save point) you make.<br>
Github is great for storing code because it organizes it all in a GUI. Provides a common hub for finding open source projects, showing off your work, and collaboration.

I think the main piece of motivation/awareness that I got from Shareef's fireside chat is DBC's focus on continual self-improvement. Shereef talks about taking control of your education, being inspired, co-creating with your cohort, giving back, and learning. When I commited to DBC, I was not thinking about this in terms of the experience. I was focused on the full-stack experience. However, I believe that continual self improvement and awareness are core pieces of my personality. I always have sought peers who do as much in the classroom or on the job as they do outside of it. I admire that DBC instills a sense of continuous improvement and involvement in software engineering because that means that DBC attracts and inspires movers and shakers. I'm excited and intrigued to work with a motivated, creative, and tenacious cohort.
