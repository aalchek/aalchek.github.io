Why use GitHub to store your code?    </p>
    <p>
The benefits of version control are
-ability for multiple people to work on same file at once without overwriting each other
-go back to earlier version (ex if hard drive crashes or if you delete something)

Git helps you keep track of your changes by allowing you to add messages to each commit (save point) you make.

Github is great for storing code because it organizes it all in a GUI. Provides a common hub for finding open source projects, showing off your work, and collaboration.
