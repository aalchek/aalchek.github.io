I think the main piece of motivation/awareness that I got from Shareef's fireside chat is DBC's focus on continual self-improvement. Shereef talks about taking control of your education, being inspired, co-creating with your cohort, giving back, and learning. When I commited to DBC, I was not thinking about this in terms of the experience. I was focused on the full-stack experience. However, I believe that continual self improvement and awareness are core pieces of my personality. I always have sought peers who do as much in the classroom or on the job as they do outside of it. I admire that DBC instills a sense of continuous improvement and involvement in software engineering because that means that DBC attracts and inspires movers and shakers. I'm excited and intrigued to work with a motivated, creative, and tenacious cohort </p>
