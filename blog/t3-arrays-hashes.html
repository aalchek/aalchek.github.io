      <span class="Week">Arrays vs Hashes: An Explanation</span><br>

  In computer science, you have different pieces of data that come in all different sizes. Some example of singular pieces of data include integers, floats, strings, and booleans. However, often times, you need to store more than one piece of data. For example, if you were going grocery shopping and needed milk, eggs, and butter, the way you would best be able to keep track of all of those ingredients is through some sort of list (rather than have a different data structure for each ingredient needed). Data structures such as arrays and Hashes are perfect for keeping track of multiple data points. An <span class=itbold>Array </span> is an ordered list that can contain strings, numbers, etc where a user can store a piece of data at a particular index. The key part is that it is ordered For example, if I had an array called Grocery_List and wanted to know the fifth item on my list(indexing starts at 0), I could just type in Grocery_List[4] and find out that I needed "5 lbs of Chicken thighs" A <span class=itbold>Hash map</span> on the other hand, is more like a dictionary. For example, in a dictionary you can look up something specific such as the definition of the word "Jam, noun (food)" and you would see the defintion "A preserve of fruit boiled with sugar". The word points to the definition in the hashmap. It's not organized by an index in the same way that an array is, but rather is more of a collection of definitions where point A directs to point B.
