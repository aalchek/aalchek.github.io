So far, my biggest struggle has been pairing. I had some understanding of CS coming into DBC and I've picked up new concepts very quickly. However, pairing has been difficult because I haven't found a good balance between driving and navigating. When I work on an exercise, sometimes when I am driving, I immediately know how to solve a problem very quickly and type out my solution before my pair can even get his/her opinion across. At the same time, when I navigate, I have to find out how I can better guide my peers without barking orders (this is an overstatement but I do want to get my point across of my weaknesses when pairing). I think that my weakness comes from how I think and learn. As someone who has focus issues, I often try and make every conversation as interactive as possible. However when pairing, I either have an idea and want to get it out as soon as possible or I want to find a way to help guide my pair without seeming too biased. My plan of action now is much like I would with any job. Keep a pad of paper next to me so I can write down my thoughts rather than implement immediately. I also think slowing down will help. Those are all my thoughts for this week!

I think the main piece of motivation/awareness that I got from Shareef's fireside chat is DBC's focus on continual self-improvement. Shereef talks about taking control of your education, being inspired, co-creating with your cohort, giving back, and learning. When I commited to DBC, I was not thinking about this in terms of the experience. I was focused on the full-stack experience. However, I believe that continual self improvement and awareness are core pieces of my personality. I always have sought peers who do as much in the classroom or on the job as they do outside of it. I admire that DBC instills a sense of continuous improvement and involvement in software engineering because that means that DBC attracts and inspires movers and shakers. I'm excited and intrigued to work with a motivated, creative, and tenacious cohort.
